# Do not use
### Requires customization, configurations and in-depth understanding of the structure
This is an incomplete project which was only intended to work once for experimental reasons. I abosultely do not recommend you use it for own purposes before completion of the project.
The Project is GPLv3 licensed and therefor you can use it as seems fit
